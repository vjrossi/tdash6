Vehicle Commands
Vehicle commands allow direct interaction with a vehicle. To accept commands, a vehicle must have an application's virtual key installed. Full details about virtual keys are available in the virtual keys developer guide. The Vehicle Command Proxy exposes a REST API for sending commands.

The Vehicle Command Proxy exposes endpoints identical to the ones described below. When it receives a request, it signs the command with a virtual key before passing the request to Fleet API. If a command is not signed, the vehicle will reject the request and perform no action. This ensures unauthorized parties are not able to send commands.

Note: The Vehicle Commands Proxy is not required for most business vehicles and Pre-2021 S and X vehicles.

Allows a user to set up Tesla mobile app access with the vehicle key card:
If a user unlocks a vehicle or authenticates it for drive with a key card, they will receive a prompt to set up their phone as key by scanning a QR code on the vehicle touchscreen.
The QR code is single-use and expires after 10 minutes.
Requires vehicle firmware version 2024.14+.
Any account that scans the QR code will gain Tesla app access to the vehicle, and download that account's Tesla profile to the vehicle.
Tesla app access allows a user to view live vehicle location, issue remote commands, and set up their phone as key within Bluetooth proximity of the vehicle.
Guest access will not have certain driver access features such as Service and Roadside.
Guest access is automatically removed when:
A key card is used to drive the vehicle.
A new QR code is scanned (only one guest is allowed at a time).
Guest Mode is disabled.
In addition, one can use the drivers remove endpoint to remotely revoke guest access.
If a user does not have the app installed, they will see this webpage (https://www.tesla.com/_gs/test) to guide them through the process.
